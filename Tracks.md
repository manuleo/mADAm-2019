# Tracks
* Joao/Dario: diet/Europe
* Manuel/Riccardo: first part

Specific idea: we have kcal/group_year/day after merge between nutrition and population -> we can divide with the number of people in each group
and we achieve kcal/persona/day in each group -> we can compare this data with FAO directly

General idea: we have kcal/persona/day from FAO, we can obtain kcal/year by multiply per people in each country and 365. In the other group
we sum and multiply per 365 and we have kcal/year total needed

# Notes
* Talk about the unit measure for the calories
* For the specific idea, the dataframe Manuel made can help in working specifically -> we could build a map in which for each country we show the problem in nutrition for age group

* Ask TA about prediction up to 2020 (which kind)
* Ask TA about drop columns/interpolate that don't match in population (intermediate years/switch of 5 years)
* Ask TA about analysis also on what they did in the past -> pick representative in space/time/grouping
* Ask TA if we are gonna move on analyze the diet directly or if we analyze which countries produce more than they need in Europe (eat more/food waste) and build the diet on this
* Ask TA what we are gonna deliver on the 25th 
* Told TA that we found another dataset with good population data
* We'll find the protein, carbo and fat needed based on our assumption on percentages (55/25/20)
* Can we compute the carbo based on fat, protein and kcal


# Next steps
* We need to add to Readme.md we have the population dataset, list of countries (found online -> link)
* Finish the analysis on kcal
* We have to add an analysis similar to the one about calories for fat, protein and carbo -> the amount of needed carbo, fat and protein came from the percentage we have.
* Add to the Readme.md link about vitamins
