    <h2>Datasets used </h2>
   <ul>
     <li> <b>FAO dataset</b> <br>
       This <a href="http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data" target="_blank">dataset</a> contains the following parameteres which were used:
       <ul>
     <li>
       <b>Food balance</b>  
This section contains food supplies for every country in the world. As the documentation reports, a region supply is defined as: “Production + imports - exports + changes in stocks (decrease or increase)”.
We will use this database to analyze the amount of kcal/person/day for each African *and* European state in the food categories we are interested in. </li>
<li>
<b> Prices </b>
As a primary resource, we used the FAO dataset to obtain prices for every food items analysed in our diet. In this context, it was not possibile to find all of them and therefore we will use also other resources that will be mentioned later on.
         </li>
<li>
<b> GDP </b>
Every country GDP was retrieved and used in order to obtain an overview on how much every European country should contribute to the cause. According to this <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp" target="_blank">website</a>, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is "the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period." For this reason, the index is the best measure to define welth distribution over European countries.
         </li>
</ul>


     <br>
     <li> <b>United Nations /DESA / Population Division</b> <br>
The dataset was retrieved at this <a href="https://population.un.org/wpp/" target="_blank">link</a>. This dataset was used to determine the male and female population for Europe and Africa from 1950 to 2020 with a granularity of 5 years. We will interpolate to obtain data with 1 year frequency. All FAO datasets are in <i> .csv </i>, so it is easy to parse and to work on. Same applies to United Nations dataset. The dimensions were overall manageable and no problems emerged.</li>
     <br>
     <li> <b>Geospatial data </b><br>
This dataset was retrieved from Kaggle at the following <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/worldbank/world-development-indicators" target="_blank">link</a> . The dataset contains the geometry of every country in the world. The dataset can be imported easily as it's a json file and also quite small. The json file will be then converted to a GeoPandas Dataframe with <i> geopandas </i> (specialized library to work with geographical visualization).</li>
     <br>
      <li> <b>USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Nutrition Facts Database (additional dataset found online) </b> <br>
      We will use this dataset to build the optimal diet. This dataset contains nutritional information for raw products, covering all those present in the FAO dataset. The information reported are per 100 g of servings.</li>
     <br>
     <li> <b>European Commission dataset</b> <br>
       This dataset (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/farming/facts-and-figures/markets/prices/price-monitoring-sector/eu-prices-selected-representative-products_en"  target="_blank">link</a>) was used to get domestic food prices for items whose prices were not included in the FAO dataset.
     </li>
     <br>
       <li> <b> Additional </b><br>     
Estimated calories needed: we scraped this <a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-2/" target="_blank">website</a> to obtain information on the average calories needed for the African population. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods </h2>
    <h3>Recurring Neural Networks (RNN)</h3>
    This widely used machine learning method was used to predict data up until the year 2020, as FAO only provides information until 2013. The RNN were prefered over a simple linear regression because the latter does not take into account intermittent outliers like periods of war or polticial instability. Additionally, the mostly exponential growth of food supply was not considered in this method. The only option would have been considering a shorter time span of data for the regression, but finding an appropriate range for every single country was virtually impossible. <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/structured_data/time_series" target="_blank">Tensorflow's</a> tutorial was used and adapted to fit this model.
    <h3>Convex Optimization  </h3>
    Two minimizations were carried out. The first tackled the issue of minimizing the amount of food that has to be delivered by the five chosen european contries. While minimizing, the demand constraints had to be respected as well as the constraints on food availability of each European country. The objective function to be minimized was a quadratic non-negative weighted sum of food [kcal/year]. More spefically, the weights were designed to take into account both the GDP of a country and the food availability [kcal/year]. The modelling choice is justified by the fact that a rich country with a large surplus should contribute more than a relatively poor country with less possibilities. The problem we want to model is a <b> Quadratic Program with Linear Constraints (QP) </b>. The choice of a quadratic objective function is due the fact that we will need to evenely distribute the resources and this means that weights will have to increase quadratically with the amount of food given away. It makes sense to say that the more a country gives away of its surplus, the less the same country should contribute further if other countries didn't countribute at all yet.
    <br>
The second optimization concerned the composition of the diet, which is one of the **key steps** of our analysis. We decided to compute the amount of product by minimizing the actual costs of shipments that every European country had to meet. In order to model the problem we needed to define an objective function which in this case was the **non-negative weighted sum of products' cost**.
