        <h3>How much does each continent have?</h3>

        Africa and Europe’s historical food situation was thoroughly analyzed. Based on past values, data was predicted and analyzed for the upcoming year 2020 in order to be as close to reality as possible. The following maps show the food that was supplied by each continent.

            In Africa, there is a clear disparity between North African countries and their sub-Saharan counterparts. All of the former ones command a supply of more than 3000 kcal per person per day except for Sudan. To put this into context: A man at the age of 20 is expected to have at least 3000 kcal per day to avoid malnutrition for sure. By hovering over a specific country, you can read the actual value. Some of the states were not listed in the FAO dataset and are consequently blank.

            As expected, most of the European countries show a stable food supply situation, with values being more homogeneous than on the African continent. Interestingly, Belgium, Austria, and Italy are provided with the highest amount per capita. Furthermore, a correlation with a nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) can be observed.

            Again, a few countries were not included in the dataset (mostly recenly established nations) and are left blank with no values assigned to them.

        <h3>How much does each continent need?</h3>
            In order to deduce a country’s demand, it would seem natural to just look at the population size multiplied by an average person’s daily need. However, this methodology would not account for different demographic compositions. The following plot illustrates the discrepancies between varying age groups and their respective nutritional requirements 
        <a href=“https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines/appendix-2/“>(Source)</a>.

            By multiplying this data with the same demographic age-range information, a much preciser number for national food demand is obtained. This takes situations into account where a nation’s population composition differs substantially to others due to wars (where the male population is significantly reduced). Additionally, the age-sex-pyramid of less developed countries often shows higher shares of young people and babies, who evidently need less than an adult person.

        Subtracting demand from the supply, deficits for the case of negative results could be determined. Move the slider on the bottom of the plots to have a look at the evolution over time.

        Various events can be put into context here, for example, the famine in Ethiopia in the ’80s, where Ethiopia figured among the countries with the highest deficit per capita. Looking at the more recent years, this animation already suggests that only by smart redistribution, Africa could sustain its own food demand. However, having the capabilities and know-how to efficiently set up a food aid operation is harder than it seems. European countries, on the other hand, have a lot more experience in this field, and they are expected to have an even higher amount of excess food, making it easier to provide for this whole operation.

    <div class="col-sm-12 col-md-4" style="border-left: solid;border-left-color: #e3e3e3;">
        Surprisingly, all European countries boast an overall surplus in the food supply, with the exception being Albania which was slightly deficient during the first few years of our investigation (‘60s). Another significant occurrence can be detected during the aftermath of <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakup_of_Yugoslavia“>Yugoslavia’s disintegration</a>
        in 1992, where ex-member states like Croatia, Bosnia & Herzegovina and former Macedonia’s nourishment status deteriorated drastically, causing a temporary shortage of nutrition. Most of the other countries, however, have constantly shown a surplus of around 1000 kcal per day and per person, meaning a third of European food does not end up being consumed - in other words: food waste.
