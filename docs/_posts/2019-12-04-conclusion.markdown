    Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the food being wasted in Europe <b> exceeds </b> by far what would actually be required to end hunger in Africa. Most of the major European nations could actually solve the problem on their own by smart redistribution. However, a combined effort of multiple nations resulted in a cost-effective scenario in which the most suitable European countries could actually solve the African hunger issue. When considering specific food items to be shipped, a diverse selection of products is determined, ensuring a well-balanced diet which enables an active lifestyle. <br>
     One of the most impactful parameters of this model is the <b> threshold </b> of food surplus, where countries located below it are considered to be in need. Changing this value by just a few calories greatly alters the model's results. For future references, this variable should therefore be meticulously assessed and implemented. To do so, each country's wealth distribution should be evaluated to detect the degree  of food consumption imbalances within the population.  
Lastly, the results of our cost analysis and its minimization could be further used to conduct a feasibility study or for governments to estimate explicit cost, allowing to allocate a specific budget for this purpose.
