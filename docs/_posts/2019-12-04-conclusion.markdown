    Most importantly, it was demonstrated that the food being wasted in Europe <b> exceeds </b> by far what would actually be required to end hunger in Africa. Most of the major European nations could actually solve the problem on their own by smart redistribution. However, an approach was chosen which includes multiple nations in order to minimize cost. When considering specific food items to be shipped, a diverse selection of products was determined, ensuring a well-balanced diet which enables an active lifestyle. <br>
     One of the most impactful parameters of this model is the <b> threshold </b> of food surplus, where countries located below it are considered to be in need. Changing this value by just a few calories greatly alters the model's results. For future references, this variable should therefore be meticulously assessed and implemented. To do so, each country's wealth distribution should be evaluated to detect the degree  of food consumption imbalances within the population.
