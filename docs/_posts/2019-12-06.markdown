Two big numbers: the total amount of surplus in Europe and Africa each (red and green color)

These are the differences in food calories supplied to how much is actually needed. In the case of Africa, this represents the total sum needed to ensure a safe provision for every citizen on the entire continent. In the case of Europe, it actually represents the surplus that is not being consumed every year. 

So why are there still people starving, you may legitimately ask. Exactly what we figured too! So we got down to work. Our final goal: Figuring out how to redistribute food while minimizing the overall effort and costs. More on that later. 
In the first part of the analysis, Africaâ€™s historical food situation was thoroughly analyzed. Based on past values, data were predicted and analyzed for the upcoming year 2020 in order to be as close to reality as possible. The following animation was generated to allow gaining insights.
